# Image Playground

This repository is a personal image scripting playground built while learning Python.

It contains small, focused scripts for experimenting with image processing tasks such as format conversion, resizing, filtering, and other transformations. The goal of this repo is to practice Python scripting, file system handling, and working with third-party libraries in a practical way.

Some scripts are inspired by or based on exercises from the Zero To Mastery Python course, but all implementations are written and extended by me for learning and experimentation purposes.

## Current Scripts

### JPG to PNG Converter

A command-line script that:

* Takes a source folder containing image files
* Converts supported images to PNG format
* Saves the converted images to a destination folder
* Automatically creates the destination folder if it does not exist
* Skips files that cannot be opened as images and reports them in the terminal

---

## Usage

Scripts in this repository are intended to be run from the command line.

Example usage:

```
python script_name.py <source_folder> <destination_folder>
```

Each script may have slightly different arguments depending on its purpose.

## Purpose of This Repository

* Practice Python scripting and automation
* Learn how to work with image processing libraries (such as Pillow)
* Improve comfort with OS-level tasks like directory handling and batch processing
* Serve as a growing collection of small, reusable image utilities

This repository is expected to grow over time as new scripts are added.

---

## Notes

* This is a learning-focused repository.
* Scripts prioritize clarity and correctness over advanced abstractions.
* Some exercises are course-inspired, but code is written and adapted independently.

---

## Requirements

* Python 3
* Pillow (PIL)

---

## Status

Active learning project — scripts may evolve, improve, or be refactored over time.
